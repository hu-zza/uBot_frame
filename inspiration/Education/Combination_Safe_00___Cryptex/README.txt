# Summary

<b><font size="4">DESCRIPTION:</font></b>
A five or seven character cryptex that can be used as a small safe / money box and is ideal for storing small valuable items that need the kind of security that only comes form a pocket sized safe made of plastic.  
Enjoy! 
<br> 
<b><font size="4">KEY FEATURES:</font></b>
•	100,000 or 10,000,000 possible combinations for the 5 ring and 7 ring versions respectively.  

•	Each ring can be set to a custom number and can be changed at any time, by anyone possessing the combination to unlock the cryptex + Locking Tool.   

•	If you wish, you can design your own custom combination rings with this, easy to use <a href="http://www.openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a> file:  <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2224399/">Outer Ring Customizer (OpenScad)</a>.

•	Sturdy construction. Unlike many other designs, this one features a locking component that holds the cryptex together even when open, thus stopping it from fall apart while in this state.  

•	Easy print. Designed specifically for the 3D printing there is very little by way of overhangs and thus no support structures are needed. Theoretically the parts should require no cleaning and can be assembled strait off the build plate. All .STL file have already been rotated for best print results.  
<br> 
<b><font size="4">IMPORTANT NOTES:</font></b>
1) Although there are no support structures to clean up i have fount, on account of the components being a naturally snug fitting, even small imperfections in the print can cause parts to become tight or catch.  So keep the craft knife or sandpaper on hand just in case :)

2) I have created a couple of remixes of this design that you might also like to check out:

<b><font size="4">MODIFICATION UPDATES:</font></b>
<font size="2">Date:10.05.15 
Component:			Lid_v1  
Modification: 	                The lid is now slightly shorter which should solve the stiffness of the bottom ring.  
<br> Date:	                        10.05.15  
Component:			Bottom_lock_v1  
Modification:             	Added a chamfer to outer bottom edge to                                 prevent over tight tolerances from flare out.  
<br> Date:				15.11.15  
Component:			Lid_v2  
Modification: 	                Have made tiny reduction to diameter of outer edge, so it should fit into the outer_ring more easily now.
<br> Date:				16.12.15  
Component:			Bottom_Lock_v2  
Modification:               	Moved the lip so the it releases the locking tool when turned clockwise too the locked position and vice versa.
<br> Date:				16.12.15  
Component:			Bottom_v3  
Modification: 	                fractionally wider inner diameter to provent tapering of Inner_tube which caused the Lid to be stick.
<br> Date:				16.12.15  
Component:			Locking_tool_v2  
Modification:  	                Mostly just a cosmetic change 
<br> Date:				13.03.16  
Component:			Inner_Shaft_7R_v0  
Modification:  	                A taller version of the original design, allowing it to accommodate two additional rings.
<br> Date:				13.03.16  
Component:			Lid_7R_v0  
Modification:  	                A taller version of the original design, allowing it to accommodate two additional rings.
<br> Date:				13.03.16  
Component:			Locking_tool_7R_v0  
Modification:  	                A taller version of the original design so it can be used with the 7 ring version of the cryptex. 
<br> Date:				28.03.16  
Component:			Lid_R5_Holey_v0
Modification: 	               Alternative lid design.  Added holes to the lid so its easier to see inside.
