# Summary

Unleash those cheap geared DC motors in order to run any Lego gears and wheels and gain access to unlimited possibilities using all Lego technic stuff.

Part was tested and refined several times in order to work seamlessly on our Prusa I3 printer. Its possible that on a different printer , you will have to clean or file the hole a bit or even change its size. However.. - for us... it works really great ! 

Part was created and developed by Tamar Ostfeld (11 years old)... Give her a like if you use it :-)
