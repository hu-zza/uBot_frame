# Summary

This is my first original design, working on the ubiquitous Robot Car Kit commercially available. For a number of reasons, I've favoured the 2-wheeled ones.

These kits usually come with an acrylic, laser-cut chassis, that's easy to mass-produce, but very fragile: I mishandled mine and it ended up shattered on the floorâ€¦

At this point, I also knew the shortcomings of the original kit, so in designing mine I added a few new features:

- The rear wheel doesn't support sharp turns, it sways too much, so I'd be using a ball bearing
- I wanted to have as much space on the top side as possible, so the battery pack (a phone Power Bank, in my case) had to be positioned on the bottom side
- The motor supports were weak, and cracked easily, so I've re-engineered them

The first version (purple in the photos) had the pieces glued: it's worked beautifully, but I wanted something even easier to put together, and that didn't need to accurately measure the positions when assembling.

I've then modified all the pieces with inserts, and with the attached design the pieces snap together and stay in place with no glue: I had left in a screw slot in case the two main halves weren't firm enough, but I ended up not using it in the final assembly (it's there in the original glued build).

YMMV, obviously: it may happen the inserts are too loose (use a bit of glue) or too tight (nothing that a bit of sandpaper can't solve).

The pen holder is optional (and it's the only piece that doesn't snap in place - you can use glue or nut & bolt): I've modified it from [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1052725), making it bigger to fit the markers available around here.

I've made all the other pieces with Tinkercad, the designs are available separately.
The full chassis is on [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/gGIWb2aqz0D)

__Update 12th May 2018__

I've uploaded a different version (the new pieces are marked wit _v2_, if there's only one version of the piece then it's unchanged), with the following differences:

- The back is now as long as the front, so the total length of the chassis is 200 mm: this allows for the positioning of a battery dedicated to the motors, while the power bank still provides the 5 V for the electronics
- The wheels are now mounted backwards, to have the center of rotation in a more neutral position
- The hole for the pen is still centered between the 2 wheels, so its position is behind the holes for the wiring.

New pictures have been uploaded to show the changes.

__Update 19th May 2018__

Added an optional support for optical encoders: a picture shows how they're mounted over the existing motor support. There's one, that needs to be mirrored, same as for the motor support.

__Update 20th May 2018__

Added a different, low profile pen holder, embedded in a fake cockpit: this is exclusively for aesthetics, and print as a single object, however it's also available on [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/aVVQlMA9k00), if you want to use only part of it

# Print Settings

Printer: Anycubic Kossel Linear Plus
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.2
Infill: 40%

Notes: 
The back ball bearing has a 20% infill.
For the flat areas, is advisable to have at least a brim (I've used 8mm)
There is only one motor support, you need to print 2 that mirror each other, so that the slot to fit the opto encoder is on the inner side.
Similarly, the Power Bank holder needs to be printed twice, mirroring is preferred but it will still do if it's not.
