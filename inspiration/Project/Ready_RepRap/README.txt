# Summary

The Ready RepRap is a delta type 3D printer designed to be quickly assembled in a classroom with minimal tools using mostly low cost easily available parts. The design uses a minimal 3d-printed parts count. 

The printer uses electrical metal tubing (EMT) for the linear motion rails, and commonly available electrical boxes to squarely mount the tubes between a wooden top and base. 

The Ready RepRap is designed around an Arduino type microcontroller such as the Mega/RAMPS running open source firmware such as Marlin.  The controller parts, stepper motors, hotend, and filament extruder are parts that will need to be ordered online. 

The printer can be configured to print with either ABS or PLA type filaments, and has a cylindrical build volume measuring 10 inches in diameter and up to 12 inches tall. 

The hardware scheme is very easy to scale up or down for different versions of this printer if you want to experiment on your own!
