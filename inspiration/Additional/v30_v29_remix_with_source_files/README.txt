# Summary

So Joseph Zisa is either refusing to share CAD files of his v29 whistle or doesn't have those.
So I decided to make my own based on his.

This one is created from scratch, I only used general idea of Joseph Zisa for that design.

**Please note that the license is different for this one:**
It's **GNU GPL v3**.

Shape Is a bit different and there is no internal ribs so you can print it much faster without loosing any function (probably shouldn't print this without infill).
And much cheaper, because thermoplastic can be expensive.
And it can be much lighter, thus allowing it to easier staying afloat if printed with less infill.
It doesn't need all that extra weight from redundant ribs v29 have.

The sources is there:

K, I printed and tested one.
In my ears it sounds way louder than v29.
Holy shit, it's ringing still.
Don't use it in enclosed room.

UPD: added branding and some details.
I am too lazy to make separate unbranded version.
You are totally allowed to make unbranded version.
You are even allowed to put any text or logo on it, just don't claim the authorship.

UPD1: added unbranded version for easier re-branding or just if you don't like having all those letters.

UPD2: tested it outside.
Bloody ginger it's loud.
Ears are ringing still even though I was in open field.

UPD3: looks like Onshape guys are changing the interface once again and export button for anonymous viewers moved to unknown place. Snapshots in every available format are added to the Thingiverse.

# Print Settings

Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.4 and higher
Infill: 10-100%

Notes: 
Nozzle up to 0.6mm should be fine.
Infill is not required but highly recommended.
Material should not matter.

I tested it on 0.4Ã—0.2 resolution with 20% infill, works fine and looks nice.
